# Image Recognition- Neural Networks

In the directory gestures, there is a set of images1 that display "down" gestures (i.e., thumbs-down images) or other gestures. Implementation of the Back Propagation algorithm for Feed Forward Neural Networks to learn down gestures from training images available in downgesture_train.list. The label of an image is 1 if the word "down" is in its file name; otherwise the label is 0. The pixels of an image use the gray scale ranging from 0 to 1. In your network, I've used one input layer, one hidden layer of size 100, one output node and value 0.1 for the learning rate. 
For each perceptron, I've used the sigmoid function ÆŸ(s) = 1/(1+e-s) 


The image file format is "pgm" <http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/pgm.html>. Please follow the link for the format details.
